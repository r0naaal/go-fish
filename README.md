# Go Fish Java Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic card game **Go Fish** in Java.

## About

This project started as a school assignment, but I decided to step it up and make it the best one in the class. My main goal was to use this as a learning project while getting myself comfortable with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, keeping data isolated, and writing code that is easy to read, understand, and follow. The logic may not be the most efficient, but it is intentionally kept simple for clarity.

## Features

- Play Go Fish against AI or with multiple players.
- Animated text output for a more engaging experience.
- AI players with random names and basic decision-making.
- Clear separation of game logic, player, card, and deck classes.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or higher).
3. Compile the source files in the `src` directory:
    ```sh
    javac src/*.java
    ```
4. Run the game:
    ```sh
    java -cp src GoFish
    ```

## Learning Focus

- Practiced OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and class design.
- Focused on keeping logic simple and data isolated within classes.
- Wrote code that is easy to follow for anyone learning Java or OOP.
